​	*Unfortunately, at first time, because of my poor knowledge of action on Linux system, I type in a wrong gcc command, and my DNSClient.c file disappear... I was trying to figure out what can I do to recover my disappeared file. However, it seemed like that there is no room for redemption* :)
​	*Finally, I decided to rewrite them. So this is my second attempt...*

> On May 21, 2023 at 3:13, version 1.0 was finally tested and can now be queried on the network DNS server. Let's remember this memorable day.

> On May 23, 2023 at 19:19, DNSLocalServer 1.0 was finally tested and can now be queried on local DNS server.

> On May 29, 2023 at 17:04, DNSLocalServer 2.0 was finally tested and can query from root server.
> On June 5, 2023 at 17:40, DNS_Client_Server system was implemented which **support query type of A, CNAME, MX, PTR**.
> Should be my last version.
